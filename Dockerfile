# Immutable release identity is public metadata, not a credential. Production
# builds pass both args from the signed full-stack release descriptor. Unknown
# defaults keep ordinary local builds working but make /v1/capabilities fail
# closed until an identity is deliberately supplied.
#
# These args are LINKED INTO the binary (see the build stage). The matching ENV
# lines in the runtime targets are a legacy fallback for images that embedded
# nothing: a container recreated against a cached image picks up a new
# environment while still running old code, so an env var can only ever assert an
# identity, never prove one. `docker run <image> version` reports both and flags
# a disagreement.
