// `reserved_tokens=token_reservation`, `grant.request_count += 1`). A failed

// (`if not usage_available: prompt_tokens = request.reserved_tokens`,
// inference.py:543-547). So attempt N costs the grant one request and a whole
// reservation whether or not the provider did any work. That ledger is the
// grant's CAPACITY budget -- it is not the miner's scored usage, which this
// broker books separately and only from a successful attempt -- but it is still
// finite, and a large cap here could exhaust a grant mid-run and convert a
// survivable blip into the very failure the retry exists to prevent.
//
