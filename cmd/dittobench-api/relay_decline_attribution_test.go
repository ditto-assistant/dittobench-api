// The rollout invariant, which is a different property from the classification
// invariant and is easy to satisfy the first and break the second.
//
// ditto-subnet's _sandbox_infrastructure_failure_code returns None for any code
// outside its allowlist, and None becomes fail_job("scoring_error"). So the
// no-fault class is only no-fault on validators that recognise the specific
// code: introducing a NEW infrastructure code silently charges miners on every
// validator that predates the matching release, for as long as the fleet lags.
// It lags by design.
//
// The two directions are therefore NOT symmetric, and this pins the asymmetry:
//
//   - New AGENT codes are skew-safe. An old validator sees
//     sandbox_failure/retryable=false and its terminal default is already the
//     intended outcome, so it needs to know nothing about the code.
//   - New INFRASTRUCTURE codes are not. Every no-fault failure this package can
//     produce must use a code already deployed everywhere.
//
// `model_relay_unavailable` has been in that allowlist since the code existed.
// If a future change wants a genuinely new no-fault code, the validator side
// has to ship and the fleet has to roll FIRST, and this test is where that
// conversation starts.
