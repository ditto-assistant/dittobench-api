// Public dataset sampler (task #52).
//
// Serves a full, real run-size DatasetArtifact from a reserved public seed so the
// community can inspect exactly what a validator scores, answer keys included.
// This is the same artifact the open generator (dittobench-datagen) produces for
// the same seed, offered over HTTP so no Go toolchain is needed for a quick look.
//
// It is not redacted. Redaction only made sense while the generator was secret;
// now that the generator is public, the full dataset for any seed is derivable by
// anyone, so hiding answer keys here would add complexity without protecting
// anything. Anti-overfit does not rely on secrecy: the seed for a scored
// submission is derived on-chain after the miner commits, so it cannot be
// predicted, and these sample seeds are drawn from a reserved NEGATIVE range that
// never collides with a real (non-negative) scored seed. The sampler still never
// accepts a caller-supplied raw seed, so it cannot be pointed at a specific
// submission.
